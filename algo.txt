FIND HITLER

Objective: From any article on wikipedia, follow the links within the article until we reach the article for Adolf Hitler

SOLUTION 1 - TOPIC HOPPING:

* Once we get to Germany, the search is over and the next step is to get the link for Adolf Hitler.

* In order to get to the article for germany we need to get to pages that pertain to geography, then search for articles about Europe.

* The main hurdle with this "topic hopping" method is determining which pages correspond to the topics we are looking for.

TRY 1:
    1.) Continue to follow links until the pages for either Europe, Germany or Adolf Hilter are reached
    2.) If Adolf Hitler, then we are done
    3.) If Germany, find link for hitler
    4.) If Europe, then go to germany, then to hitler
